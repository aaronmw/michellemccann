bio: |
    My family moved to Toronto when I was ten. To support my family, my dad took a
    second job delivering newspapers and I would often help him. Surrounded by
    thick stacks of newspapers in the backseat of the car, I read about the latest
    political dramas and international intrigues of the day. I was hooked.  I
    spent the rest of my school years dreaming of working at a newspaper.

    After completing degrees in Political Science and Public Relations, I worked in
    a media relations unit in government. It was my job to read the news every day,
    all day and to respond to calls from reporters.

    I’ve recently completed a postgraduate journalism program and I am currently an
    intern at the CBC. My work has appeared in Beach Metro News, Maclean’s, and
    the Toronto Observer.
